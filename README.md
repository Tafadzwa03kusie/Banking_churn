# Banking_churn
### Definition
Predicting customer churn involves identifying the clients most likely to stop using your service or cancel their subscription. This is due to the fact that obtaining new clients frequently costs more than maintaining current ones.

In this project we are tying to visualize and identify the factors/features that contributes to the churn of customers.

### Dataset Used
In the dataset, the following information was provided:

RowNumber — the record (row) number.

CustomerId — contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank.

Surname

CreditScore

Gender

Age 

Tenure — refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank

Balance 

NumOfProducts — refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.

HasCrCard — denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card.

IsActiveMember

EstimatedSalary

Exited — whether or not the customer left the bank. This is what we have to predict. (0=No,1=Yes). This is going to be our target variable.

#### Effect on the customer leaving the bank?
RowNumber, CustomerId and Surname have no effect on customer leaving the bank.
Other attributes are more or less likely to have an effect.

The goal is to construct and train a machine learning model to predict the possibility of churns and help custumer service target the factors that may lead to churn and prevent customer churn, reduce loss of profit.
